Assignment 2: Calculate Salary
//An employee gets paid (hours worked) × (base pay), for each hour up to 40 hours.
//For every hour over 40, they get overtime = (base pay) × 1.5.
//The base pay must not be less than the minimum wage ($8.00 an hour). If it is, print an error.
//If the number of hours is greater than 60, print an error message
